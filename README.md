# NLP Assignment Projects

## Overview
This repository contains three assignments completed for the Natural Language Processing course at University of Naples "Parthenope". Each assignment explores different fundamental aspects of NLP, from basic text preprocessing to advanced language modeling techniques.

## Assignments

### 📄 Assignment 1: Text Processing Fundamentals
Focus: Basic corpus analysis and preprocessing techniques.

Key Topics:
- **Corpus Loading**: Working with NLTK's Gutenberg corpus (Jane Austen's "Persuasion")
- **Text Statistics**: Calculating word frequencies and vocabulary analysis
- **Zipf's Law**: Empirical verification of Zipf's distribution in natural language
- **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, punctuation removal, case normalization
- **Visualization**: Frequency distribution plots using matplotlib and seaborn
- **Stopword Analysis**: Comparing word frequencies with and without stopwords

## 📊 Assignment 2: Sentiment Analysis with Twitter Data
Focus: Machine learning for sentiment classification.

Key Topics:

- **Dataset**: Twitter sentiment analysis corpus

- **Preprocessing**: Tweet cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction

Classification Models:

- **Naive Bayes**: Probabilistic classification using Bayes' theorem
- **Logistic Regression**: Linear model for binary classification
- **Model Evaluation**: Accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix
- **Feature Engineering**: Bag-of-words, TF-IDF representations

## 🔤 Assignment 3: Language Modeling with N-grams
Focus: Statistical language modeling techniques.

Key Topics:

- **N-gram Models**: Building unigram, bigram, and trigram models
- **Probability Matrix**: Calculating transition probabilities between words
- **Perplexity**: Evaluating language model performance using perplexity metric
